## üß© How to Use

### 1. Enable the Plugin

- Go to **Project ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí Plugins**
- Enable `PointMaker`

### 2. Add a PointMaker Node

- In the scene tree, click the "+" button to add a new node.
- Search for any of the following custom nodes:
  - `PointTrigger`
  - `PointHover`
  - `PointHold`
  - `PointDrag`
  - `PointSnap`
  - `PointRadial`
  - `PointSliderH`
  - `PointSliderV`

### 3. Add a `CollisionShape2D`

> This is **required** for most nodes to detect collisions or mouse input.

- Right-click your PointMaker node ‚Üí Add Child Node ‚Üí `CollisionShape2D` (or `CollisionPolygon2D`)
- Set its `shape` (e.g., `RectangleShape2D`, `CircleShape2D`)
- Resize as needed to define the interactive area

### 4. Configure the Node in the Inspector

Each node exposes properties in the Inspector for customizing its behavior. Common options include:

- **Sounds**: Add one or more `AudioStream` files
- **Animation Player**: Provide a node path to the `AnimationPlayer` to trigger
- **Animation Name**: Name of the animation to play
- **Scene to Load**: Optional `.tscn` path to change scenes when triggered

- **Drag/Snap/Slider/Knob Options**: See below for node-specific properties
